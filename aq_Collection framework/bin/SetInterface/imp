  Comparable(I)
  ------------------

It is present in java.lang package and it contains only one method compareTo()

public int compareTo(Object object)
 
  obj1.compareTo(obj2) 
                     ---> returns -ve if obj1 has to come before obj2  ( "A".compareTo("Z")); // -ve
                     ---> returns +ve if obj1 has to come after  obj2  ( "Z".compareTo("A")); // +ve
                     ---> returns 0   if obj1 & obj2 are equal
                     
                             obj1 -> The object which is to be inserted
                             obj2 -> The object which is already inserted
   
   
    If we are depending on default natural sorting order then while adding objects into the TreeSet JVM will call comapreTo method.
                     
        TreeSet t = new TreeSet();
        t.add("K");  
        t.add("Z");  "Z".compareTo("K");                                       A   K   Z
        t.add("A");  "A".compareTo("K");
        t.add("A");
        Sysout(t); // [A,K,Z]
        
        
 If default natural sorting order not available or if we are not satisfied with default natural sorting order then we can go for 
 customized sorting by using comparator
 
 Comparable meant for default natural sorting whereas comparator meant for customized sorting order
 
 
 Comparator(I)
-------------------------

It is present in java.util package and its contains two methods
1) compare()
2) equals()

1)  public int compare( Object obj1, Object obj2)
                                               ---> returns -ve obj1 has to come before obj2 
                                               ---> returns +ve obj1 has to come after obj2 
                                               ---> returns 0 obj1 & obj2 are equal
                                               
2)  public boolean equals(Object obj)

Whenever we are implementing comparator interface compulsory we should provide implementation only for compare method and we are not
required to provide implementation for equals method because it is already available to our class from object class through inheritance.

        
Write a program  to insert integer objects into a TreeSet where the sorting order is descending order
In constructor calling if we  are not passing comparator object then internally JVM will call compatrTo method which is meant for
defaut sorting order
